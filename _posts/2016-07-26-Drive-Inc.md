**Fan Fiction based on motion picture: Drive (2011)**

The driver was fully focused; in the moment. They had cleared most of the road till the next
intersection. He was much more alert now. The road across ahead was moving. He wanted to
make it before the side he jumped turned green. Although, the road to the airport was straight
ahead, he wanted to take a left.

The confusion was on the passenger's mind.

The vehicle density moving across was thinning. The last of the few hurried and driverâ€™s left
side went green.

Distance from the intersection: 50m

Speed: 100kmph
